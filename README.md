I have used REFlex for many years, my gratitude to its author, AcidWeb for the excellent work he put into it. 

However, rather than waiting for support for Battleground Blitz to be added, I decided to do it myself and I took the opportunity to make other fixes and improvements while I was at it. See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

I will likely make more updates for my own personal satisfaction and I will post them here in the coming months.
